"""Rendering FL Studio projects from a script.

What this can honestly do, and what it cannot.

FL Studio takes a /R switch that renders a project, and it works, but it is not a
headless renderer. Launching it opens the application: you will see FL's window, it
loads the project, and on some versions the export dialog waits for a press of Start.
Image-Line's own forum has people asking about exactly this and getting no better
answer. So this does not pretend the render is silent. It starts FL, waits for the
output file to appear and stop growing, and reports honestly when it did not.

Waiting on the file rather than on FL's window title is deliberate. Title watching is
what most scripts do, but it breaks on a different language, a different version, and
anywhere the window is not visible. A file that has stopped growing is the same fact on
every machine.

Standard library only.
