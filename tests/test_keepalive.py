"""One connection, many requests.

The server speaks HTTP/1.1, so a browser opens one connection and sends every request
down it. That makes the request body the whole connection's problem rather than one
handler's: bytes a handler never read are still sitting in the socket when the next
request arrives, and the server parses them as that request's opening line.

The symptom is horrible to chase. A perfectly good GET comes back 501, the failure lands
on a request that did nothing wrong, and which request actually caused it depends on
which connection the browser happened to reuse. It looked like "JR!TER is not answering"
at random.

These go through http.client rather than urllib because urllib opens a fresh connection
per request and would never see it.
