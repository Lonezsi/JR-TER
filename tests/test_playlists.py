"""Running orders that hold songs and loose renders together.

The interesting part is that the two things in a playlist are not the same kind of thing.
A song has versions and a current one; a render in the Renders list has no song yet and
may never get one. Anything that could only hold songs would miss the thing people
actually do, which is line up a finished track, a rough bounce and an idea from last week
and listen straight through.

So these are mostly about the seams: what happens to a running order when the song in it
is deleted, when the render in it is thrown away, and when an album it belongs to changes
underneath it.
