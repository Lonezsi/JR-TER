"""One password, and a door.

There are no rules about what the password may be. Length limits, character classes and
"must contain a symbol" mostly push people towards one bad password reused everywhere,
and this library has exactly one user who already knows what it is worth.

What guards it instead is a limit on guessing. An attacker who gets six attempts a minute
cannot brute force even a short password, and a rate limit costs the person who knows it
nothing. That is the trade this module makes: no rules about the secret, hard limits on
attempts.

The password is never stored. It is put through scrypt, which is deliberately slow and
memory hungry, and only the result is kept.
