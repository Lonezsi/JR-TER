JR!TER ships with an open licensed typeface and will happily use a different one, but it
never carries that file. You upload it, it lives in your data directory, and it is served
only to your own library. That keeps a licensed or shareware font where its licence
expects it to be: on your machine, rather than committed to a public repository and
handed to everyone who clones it.
