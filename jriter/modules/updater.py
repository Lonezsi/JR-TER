"""Keeping JR!TER up to date from its own GitHub repository.

The check is read only and says plainly when it cannot tell. Applying an update is a
fast forward pull and nothing else: no reset, no force, no stash. If the working tree has
been edited by hand, the update refuses and says so rather than throwing that work away.
