"""Loading whichever features are switched on.

A module is a file in jriter/modules/ that may define:

    NAME     str, defaults to the file name
    SCHEMA   list of CREATE TABLE statements, run at startup, must be IF NOT EXISTS
    MIGRATE  optional. Either a callable, run after SCHEMA every time, or a list of
             (name, callable) steps, each run once ever and recorded by name
    ROUTES   callable returning {(method, pattern): handler}
    SUMMARY  optional callable returning a small dict for /api/state

Nothing else in JR!TER imports a module directly. If a name is missing from
config.MODULES the code is still on disk and simply never runs.
