 * that deliberately produces a new file, because sending a mix somewhere means sending
 * a file, and a file that does not have the curve on it is not the mix you approved.
 *
 * The chain is not rebuilt here. J.audio.chainInto builds it in whichever context it is
 * given, so the deck you listened through and the pass that writes the file are the same
 * node order by construction. Two copies would drift, and nothing could tell you: no test
 * can compare a graph in one file against a graph in another. The only defence is that
 * there is one.
 *
 * It renders faster than real time. An OfflineAudioContext runs as fast as the machine
 * can manage, so a four minute song is a few seconds, not four minutes.
