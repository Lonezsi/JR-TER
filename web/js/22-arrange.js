/* The compositor's engine: holding an arrangement, and playing a render through it.
 *
 * An arrangement is a list of clips. Each one says which stretch of the render it takes
 * and how long it is, both counted in beats, and they play back to back in order. One
 * track, no gaps, no overlaps. That is the whole model, and it is enough for the two
 * things this exists for: dropping bars out of an intro, and going round a chorus twice.
 *
 * Playback schedules a buffer source per clip rather than moving an audio element's
 * currentTime. Seeking an element takes an unpredictable moment and would put a gap at
 * every join, which is exactly where you are listening hardest.
 *
 * Each source feeds both decks at once:
 *
 *      clip 1 ─┐                    ┌─ deck A filters ─ gain A ─┐
 *      clip 2 ─┼─ scheduled in time ─┤                          ├─ master
 *      clip 3 ─┘                    └─ deck B filters ─ gain B ─┘
 *
 * so switching A to B changes which equaliser the same audio passes through, instantly
 * and without restarting anything. When the compositor is on that is all A and B do,
 * which is the point: you are comparing sounds, not takes, because there is only one
 * arrangement.
