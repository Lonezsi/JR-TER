# Run this on a repeating schedule. It is both the launcher and the watchdog: on a run
# where the library is already answering it does nothing and exits, and on a run where it
# is not, it starts one.
#
# Answering is the test, not "a process exists" and not "a port is held". A wedged server
# holds its port perfectly well while serving nobody, and that is indistinguishable from
# a crash to the person trying to open the page. So the check is an actual request.
#
# It binds to every interface. Two things need to reach it: Tailscale Funnel, which
# forwards from localhost, and the tailnet on 100.x. What makes that safe is the door:
# the auth module is loaded, so an unauthenticated caller from anywhere gets the login
# page and nothing else.
